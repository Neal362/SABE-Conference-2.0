      <p>
        Dearborn is located in Southeast Michigan and is part of the Metro Detroit area. Long
        known as the birthplace of Henry Ford, Dearborn is a city of innovation and immigration,
        where families from around the world came to build a life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Dearborn is a rich, vibrant, multicultural community where church bell towers stand
        next door to mosque minarets, and where you can find both some of the best
        <em>pączki</em> and shawarma in the United States. Dearborn is also known as the
        <strong>Coffee Capital of Michigan</strong>, with more than 45 coffee shops to explore.

      <p>
        Dearborn’s modern growth was boosted in 1917 when Henry Ford built the Ford Rouge
        Plant here. As Ford Motor Company expanded, Dearborn became its world headquarters,
        and the city now features two walkable downtowns (east and west) with restaurants,
        cafés, shops, and museums.
      </p>
      <p>
        The area around the University of Michigan–Dearborn offers easy access to historic
        sites, cultural institutions, and a wide range of dining options, all within a short drive or
        rideshare from campus.

      <p>
        Dearborn is located in the Metro-Detroit area. Dearborn borders Detroit to the north and
        east, and it is located roughly 7 miles west of downtown Detroit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Detroit is a dynamic, diverse city with an intriguing history. It is a place of people and
        places, trends and events, world-changing inventions and groundbreaking music. Long
        known as the automobile capital of the world, Detroit is also famous for its distinctive
        Motown sound from the 1960s.
      </p>

      <h3 class="eyebrow">Detroit Institute of Arts</h3>
      <p>
        The Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) has been a beacon of culture for the Detroit area since
        its founding in 1885. The DIA's collection is among the top six in the United States, with
        more than 65,000 works. In addition to outstanding American, European, Modern and
        Contemporary, and Graphic art, the museum holds significant works of African, Asian,
        Native American, Oceanic, Islamic, and Ancient art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Highlights include Diego Rivera's <em>Detroit Industry</em> fresco cycle, which Rivera
        considered his most successful work, and Vincent van Gogh's <em>Self-Portrait</em>, the
        first Van Gogh painting to enter a U.S. museum collection.

        and celebrates the past while building a bridge to the future.
      </p>

      <h3 class="eyebrow">Great Lakes &amp; Michigan’s Shorelines</h3>
      <p>
        The Great Lakes account for one fifth of the world's supply of surface fresh water, and
        Michigan is home to four of the five. Lake Michigan forms the western coast of the Lower
        Peninsula with sugar-sand shores and towering dunes, including the dramatic bluffs of
        Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. At the Straits of Mackinac, Lake Michigan meets
        Lake Huron beneath the iconic Mackinac Bridge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lake Huron spans most of Michigan’s eastern border—often called the “Sunrise Side” for
        its spectacular sunrises. To the southeast, Lake Erie provides wildlife viewing and hiking
        opportunities just a short drive from Metro Detroit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the northern shore of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula lies Lake Superior, the largest
        freshwater lake in the world by surface area. Here you can marvel at 42 miles of sandstone
        cliffs at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore and explore Isle Royale National Park, known
        for its rugged backcountry trails and thriving wildlife.
